## Hi there.

This is a slice of the internet for [@jeefy](https://twitter.com/jeefy) and [@mrbobbytables](https://twitter.com/mrbobbytables) 

Whereas [AbstractInfrastructure](https://github.com/AbstractInfrastructure) is mainly where we collaborate on training and cloud-native resources, [GrizzlyGeeks](https://github.com/GrizzlyGeeks) is where we rant, rave, kick our shoes off, and experiment. 

## Main Projects

[WTK?](https://github.com/grizzlygeeks/wtk) - Monthly podcast/live-stream going over open source news, opinions, and ideas.

[Style Guide Checker](https://github.com/grizzlygeeks/style-guide-checker) - LLM-powered GitHub action to validate PRs against a provided style-guide.
